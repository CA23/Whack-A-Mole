# Whack-A-Mole

A simple text based implementation of the Whack A Mole game

After running, the grid appears as characters with 'M' representing a mole (initially not visible),  'W' representing a whacked mole and '*' representing either an unwhacked mole or nothing in its place

User manually enters the coordinates of a location to 'whack a mole' in a square grid

Yet to debug, contains errors and warnings.
